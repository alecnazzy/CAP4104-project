        This project aims to simplify and enhance the online shopping experience
        by enabling users to shop from multiple stores through a single, unified
        cart. This platform allows users to browse and purchase items from
        various local stores without having to navigate multiple websites. Key
        features include a carousel that highlights local deals, a product
        search bar for convenient browsing, and multiple filtering and sorting
        options to refine search results. The project is designed with user
        flexibility and convenience in mind, offering custom delivery
        instructions, tipping options, and real-time updates on order progress.
        Additionally, the system logs purchase history, allowing users to easily
        reorder items. Whether shopping for groceries, electronics, or
        pharmaceuticals, this solution provides a streamlined, intuitive
        experience for users seeking to shop from multiple stores in a single
        session.
