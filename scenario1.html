    <div class="scenario">
      <p>
        Karen just finished a 12-hour shift at the hospital and is exhausted.
        She wants to make a healthy dinner, but her fridge is almost empty.
        During her train commute back home, she opens the grocery delivery app
        to save time. Upon entering her address in Manhattan, she is greeted by
        the landing page carousel, which showcases nearby stores with deals on
        fresh produce and healthy meals. Eager to find the right items quickly,
        Karen uses the product search bar to look for pre-cut vegetables and
        lean meats. To streamline her shopping experience, she applies filters
        to narrow her search, choosing groceries and organic options while
        selecting her favorite store for fresh produce. After selecting items
        from two different stores, Karen adds them to the multi-store cart.
        Since she’s in a rush, she checks the sort by price option to ensure
        she’s getting a good deal on her selected items. Before placing the
        order, Karen adds delivery instructions, requesting that the groceries
        be left at her front door, as she plans to head straight to bed upon
        arriving home. While still on the train, she takes advantage of the
        real-time order updates to track when her groceries are picked up and
        delivered. The app also reminds her of her purchase history, prompting
        her to reorder her usual fruits and coffee, which she quickly adds to
        the cart before checking out.
