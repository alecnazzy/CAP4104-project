      <p>
        James is preparing a small dinner party for his new neighbors but finds
        himself overwhelmed by the prospect of shopping in Knoxville, especially
        since he doesnâ€™t know the area well and has a tight budget. To make his
        shopping experience easier, he opens the app and enters his new address,
        setting a small search radius to find nearby stores. He starts by using
        the product search bar to find basic groceries, such as chicken, rice,
        and vegetables. To maximize his budget, he applies filters to narrow
        down stores that have sales, specifically selecting the non-perishable
        and on-sale options to find budget-friendly staples. As he browses,
        James sorts the items by purchase count to see which brands are most
        popular and trusted by others, ensuring he makes informed choices. After
        selecting items from three different stores, he relies on the
        multi-store cart to group everything in one order. Unsure about tipping,
        he notices the tipping interface that explains the optional tipping
        feature for delivery drivers and decides to leave a small tip for any
        extra effort. Once the groceries are delivered, James uses the purchase
        history feature to save the stores he liked best for future reference,
        making his next shopping experience even easier.
